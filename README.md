# Geospatial Land Classification via Image Processing using CNN

A deep learning project that classifies satellite land types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and performs crop detection on agricultural land using color-based image segmentation.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

- *Step 1*: Classify land types (e.g., agricultural, residential, forest) from satellite imagery.
- *Step 2: If land is classified as **agricultural*, detect specific crops such as:
  - Red Spinach
  - Green Wheat
  - Tea

> âš¡ Purpose: Enables smarter land use planning and precision agriculture.



## ðŸ§  Key Skills Demonstrated

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Satellite Image Classification
- HSV Color Segmentation for Crop Detection
- Image Preprocessing & Augmentation
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
